  <h1>Interneting is Easy!</h1>
  <p>Firrst, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

  <h2>Headings</h2>
  <p>Headings define the outline of my site.There are six levels of
    headings</p>

  <h2>Lists</h2>
  <p>This is how I make an unordered list</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add an "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
    <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
    <li>They do not need to be in any particular order</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This is what an ordered list looks like</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
    <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
    <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
    <li>I should be noticing things in this precise order because
    this is an ordered list</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
  <p><em>Sometimes</em>, I need to draw attention to a particular word or
  phrase.</p>
  <p><em><strong>And sometimes I need to shout!</strong></em></p>
