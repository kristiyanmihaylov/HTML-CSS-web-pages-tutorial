    <h1>Interneting is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First,we need to learn some basic HTML</p>
    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six
      levels of headings</p>
    <h3>Lists</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element(it stands for unordered lits)</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
      <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
      <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order,
      because this is an ordered list</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Inline Elements</h3>
      <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular
      word or phase</p>
      <p>Other times you need to <strong>strongly</strong> emphasize the
      importance of a word or phase</p>
      <p><em><strong>Yeah,shout!</strong></em></p>
